# open-numismat
OpenNumismat, is intended primarily for registering a collection of coins. But it is also suitable for other types of collectibles - stamps, postcards, badges and more exotic things.

The application is written in Python, data is stored using a SQLite database, PyQt is used for the interface, data access and much more, Jinja2 is used for generating reports, and Matplotlib is used to build statistics graphs. Despite my initial skepticism, this was enough to ensure acceptable performance â€” several thousand image records are processed without any noticeable brakes.
Since all components are cross-platform, then OpenNumismat has builds for Windows, Linux (Debian / Ubuntu), macOS.
